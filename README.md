## Engineering Practices

### Coding Standards

We follow industry-standard coding conventions and styles to maintain a consistent and readable codebase. Please refer to the [coding standards document](docs/coding-standards.md) for details.

### Code Reviews

All code changes go through a thorough review process. Pull requests must be submitted, reviewed, and approved before merging into the main branch.

### Testing

We prioritize automated testing to ensure the reliability of the codebase. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are included in the testing suite.

## DevOps

### Continuous Integration (CI).

We use a CI pipeline to automate the build and testing processes. Every push to the repository triggers the CI pipeline, ensuring that the code is continuously integrated and validated.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

Our CD pipeline automates the deployment process. Successful builds from the CI pipeline are automatically deployed to staging environments for further testing. Manual approval is required to promote changes to production.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The project's infrastructure is defined as code using tools like Terraform or Ansible. This allows us to version control and track changes to the infrastructure, making it reproducible and scalable.
